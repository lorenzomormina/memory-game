folder "save", containing an "index.json" and multiple files
    index.json:
        lastId: $
        matches: [
            {
                id: $

    match-$.txt contains the steps that can be "replayed" inside the application


plan:

button changes color on hover
"Reset" is the only button and clicking it will open a confirmation prompt
code functionality to have less cards to play with, can be set in settings.json
save steps in memory and, when done, button appears to save the match data and steps to be replayed later
main menu with: play or replay.
replay shows a list of games. double click one to view.

tilde opens a console
`enable_debugging()` uses lua to enable debugging mode
when debugging, a floating window appears with some functions
    "Reload UI" / F5 / `reload_ui()`
    "Random Card" / random_card()
    "Debug OFF" / disable_debugging()



---

- wait time between cards reveal, especially between cards disappear or turn back down.
- animation when turning cards (either rotating, or transparent phasing)
- debug should be activated through a keybinding (F3, like minecraft), after showing a comfirmation prompt.
- reset comfirmation prompt
- when cards are clicked to fast, attempts increment only by 1

+ use tilde/grave to open console command
+ be able to write inside console command
+ integrate lua and interop
+ send commands through console, start with resize_console and move_console

- f5 without changing config, does something which shouldn't do
